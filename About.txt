Project Highlight: Real-Time Seismic Monitoring and Alert System** üåç

I'm excited to share a recent project where I utilized a Globfone sensor to measure frequencies from the Earth, effectively creating a digital seismograph. This innovative approach enables the detection of seismic activities with high accuracy.

Key features of the project include:

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: The Globfone sensor captures and transmits seismic data in real-time.
- **Digital Seismograph**: The system converts these frequencies into a digital seismograph, providing precise readings.
- **Automated Alerts**: When the scale exceeds a certain threshold, the system automatically sends alert messages via a GSM network, ensuring timely warnings.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging MATLAB's ThinkSpeak Cloud service, the seismic data is visualized in real-time, allowing for easy monitoring and analysis.

This project demonstrates the potential for advanced seismic monitoring systems that can provide critical alerts and real-time data visualization, enhancing safety and preparedness.
